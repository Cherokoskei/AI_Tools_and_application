This project explores three core areas of AI development:

  - Classical Machine Learning using Scikit-learn to build a decision tree classifier on the Iris dataset.

   - Deep Learning with TensorFlow, building a CNN model to classify MNIST handwritten digits with >95% accuracy.

  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) using spaCy to extract named entities and analyze sentiment in Amazon product reviews.

The project includes Jupyter notebooks for each task, an ethical reflection, a debugging challenge, and an optional Streamlit deployment for interactive model demos. AI_Tools_and_application
